# Project 01: ER Diagram

Please follow the description of the expected functionality for your project in order to come up with an ER diagram for the data that will be stored persistently in the database. The description is posted under `Resources`.

Note that verbs like "create/insert/delete/update" are functions for your system to perform and will likely not appear in your ER domain model (as relationships).

Instructions:
1. Only ONE member from each team should submit.
2. All submissions should be in .pdf format.
3. All submissions should have the name ER_Group# (e.g. ER_Group14.pdf).
4. Every submission should contain all the group names.
