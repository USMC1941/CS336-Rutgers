# Project 04: Final Project Submission

Each group should submit the following 5 files, under the name of only one team member. The file names should be preceded by your team number (e,g, For group number 19, `#schema.sql` should be `19schema.sql`).

One submission per group:

1. `#projectCode`: A tar/zip file of all the project code the group has written. Please submit all your eclipse project from your workspace (all your `.java`, `.jsp`, `.html` files etc. ), NOT your `.war` file.
2. `#schema.sql`: The SQL file for your DB schema (you have to export it from your MySQL workbench)
3. `#ER_diagram`: Your final ER diagram.
4. `#README.txt`: This contains:
   -  Your URL where we can run the project from Amazon EC2.
   -  Your Apache Tomcat credentials.
   -  The contents of the private key `.pem` file (if you don't remember what this file is, please check the `AWS_EC2-2019.pdf`, page 11).
   -  The username and password of your Apache Tomcat manager (see `AWS_EC2.pdf` page 31).
   -  Admin credentials so we are able to login as an admin
   -  A list that apportions credit (possibly shared) for each code file to the team members. (It would also be good to have these as comments in your code files). Anything else that you want us to know about your project should be mentioned here. If your think that the everyone contributed equally, just write that in your file without specifying who did which files.
5. `#ProjectChecklist.docx`: This file is under your project resources. Note that everything marked with "`*`" in the checklist means that it is not basic feature.

IMPORTANT: The code SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED after the final submission in your Tomcat! (If you are caught making changes, the minimum penalty will be 0 on the whole project.)
