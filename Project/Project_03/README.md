# Project 03: Login web application

Please develop two simple web pages: one to create an account with login name and password, and one to log in to an already created account. This information should be stored in/accessed from your database.  You might want to have an `index.html` page to select between these.

The idea is that these are very simple jsp pages - we just want to make sure that each team has created an AWS account with a MySQL RDS instance and everyone has understood how to use jsp, JDBC, MySQL, etc. to do something simple (everything we did in the lectures together).

1. Please submit, in the form of a ZIP file, the web application (all the folder from eclipse) you have created that lets a user to create an account and log in the system.

2. Please submit as text the URL of the start page of the project where we can access your web application. In order to do so you will have to create an AWS EC2 instance. Please check `Amazon_EC2.pdf`.
