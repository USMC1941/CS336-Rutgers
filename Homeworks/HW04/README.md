# HW04: EER Diagram to Relational Schema

Please consider the attached EER diagram, which is a partial solution for the Bank modeling assignment.

Please provide a description of the best relational tables for this application, based on the principles/techniques presented in class (and which are also the basis of the design methodology in the textbook). To save space/time, do not provide datatype descriptions of columns; just give primary key, unique, not null, & foreign key constraints where appropriate, as well 'on delete/update' statements. Please name the tables by the corresponding entity or relationship name, and when merging tables, keep only the name of the table you merge into. Give the table definitions in alphabetical order (so the grader can find them more easily).

You may assume that all attributes have values for entity/relationship sets on which they are presented.

Include Primary Key, Foreign Key and Composite Primary Key on each table.
