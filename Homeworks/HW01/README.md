# HW01: Connect through Foreign Key

The purpose of this HW1 is to create a relationship based on the tables presented.  Always look at two tables at a time.  Identify if the relationship exists and if you can find one table's foreign key, you can use it to connect to the other table's primary key.  You need to understand the concept of the composite primary key. Your answer should identify the relationship between 2 tables (1 to 1, 1 to many or many to 1) at a time.  Define relationship(s) that makes sense (not to connect every table to each other).

Please see the attached picture file. You can simply print out the picture file then draw the link(s) if you think the two tables can have relationship, and scan the result as picture file and submit the file before the due date.
